        <p>The New York City subway system opened on October 27 1904, and was built by the interborough rapid transit company. It is one of the world's oldest public transit systems, as well as one of the most-used, and with the most stations. The New York City Subway is the largest rapid transit system in the world, by number of stations, with 472 stations in operation. It all started with the New York City subway tokens, introduced in 1953. The demise of the token has been expected ever since 1994 when New York became one of the last subway systems in the country to introduce fare cards. The blue and yellow MetroCards are cheaper to produce and can be programmed to offer discounts and transfers. Emptying tokens from turnstiles and delivering them to token booths is time-consuming and expensive. Phasing out the token, transit officials say, will save $6 million a year in handling costs. The transit system of New York City can take you to all five boroughs, and as far as coney island.</p>
